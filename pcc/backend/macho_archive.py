"""Static archive (`.a`) reading and member selection.

The remaining half of LINK-P1-MACHO-LINK-STATIC and the prerequisite for
routing pcc's own link path at the runtime archive: an archive is not a bag
of objects, it is a *pool* the linker draws from, and which members it pulls
is a semantic decision — pull a member only when it defines a symbol that is
currently undefined, then repeat, because a newly pulled member can itself
reference something no one had needed yet.

Format handled: Darwin BSD `ar` — the `!<arch>` magic, 60-byte member
headers, `#1/<n>` extended names (the name follows the header and is counted
in the member size), and the `__.SYMDEF`/`__.SYMDEF SORTED` table of
contents, which is skipped rather than trusted: pcc reads each member's own
symbol table, so a stale or absent index cannot change what gets linked.

Fail closed on a non-archive, a truncated member, or a member that is not a
Mach-O object.

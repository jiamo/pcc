"""Link a pcc-produced executable: dyld surface, stubs, GOT, entry point.

LINK-P1-MACHO-LINK-DYLD. `macho_link` merges objects and resolves symbols;
this module turns the merged object into an `MH_EXECUTE` that dyld loads:
addresses assigned, relocations *applied* (not just recorded), libSystem
imports bound through `__stubs` + `__got` with chained fixups, and the whole
thing ad-hoc signed by `macho_codesign` — no ld, no as, no codesign.

Binding mechanism, chosen and pinned: `LC_DYLD_CHAINED_FIXUPS` with
`DYLD_CHAINED_PTR_64_OFFSET`, which needs macOS 12+. That minimum is recorded
in `LC_BUILD_VERSION` (the row asks for the choice and its OS floor to be
explicit, since chained fixups do not exist on older loaders); classic
`LC_DYLD_INFO_ONLY` is deliberately not implemented rather than half-built.

Scope is pcc's own link job: one `__TEXT` (text/stubs/cstring/const), one
`__DATA` for mutable data, `__DATA_CONST` for the GOT. Anything else — a
section the layout does not know, a relocation type outside the proven set,
a missing entry symbol — raises `LinkError` instead of producing a binary
that fails inside dyld.

LINK-P3-PARALLEL keeps every semantic/layout pass above ordered.  Only after
all file offsets are frozen does it materialise disjoint output regions through
bounded workers; signing still consumes the one complete deterministic prefix.

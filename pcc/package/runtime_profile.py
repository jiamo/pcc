"""Runtime-profile invariance and capability-tagged artifact contract.

Package environment identity is keyed only by the semantic Python target,
pcc-native ABI, target triple, and package ABI mode
(``pcc/package_environment.py``). Runtime policy — GC backend, execution
backend owner, threaded runtime, virtual-thread scheduling, accelerator
availability — must never key the environment root, the sync key, or the
per-package build keys: switching policy reuses the same installed CPU
package graph with zero acquisition and zero rebuild work.

Optional device payloads (Metal today) are capability-tagged artifacts
declared *inside* a package's distribution manifest, not extra environment
dimensions. Selecting a capability that is unavailable on the host or not
shipped by the package fails closed with a stable diagnostic; there is no
silent fallback to another capability, package site, or implementation.

This module is host-side package tooling; it is intentionally not part of
the pcc1 bootstrap closure.

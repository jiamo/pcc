"""Stable serialization of ``pcc.ast.c_ast`` trees for differential
testing of C parsers.

The normalized form:
- Each node is a dict ``{"_t": "NodeTypeName", <attr_name>: <value>, ...}``
- Attributes listed in ``node.attr_names`` are serialized by value
- Children from ``node.children()`` are serialized recursively
- Source coordinates are **dropped** (they're formatting-dependent and
  diverge between parsers that keep different spans)
- Node identity (id(node), weakref targets) is dropped

The output is JSON-compatible — list/dict/str/int/float/None — so any
two implementations of a C parser producing structurally equal trees
will serialize byte-identical.

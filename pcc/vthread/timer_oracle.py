"""CPU-only oracle for a scalable virtual-thread timer structure.

This module is an ORACLE, not the runtime. It exists to design and validate
the *algorithm* that a later C slice under ``pcc/py_runtime/src/pcc_threads.c``
will mirror, replacing the current O(n)-insert sorted singly-linked timer
queue (``pcc_vthread_timer_add_locked`` / ``py_virtual_thread_poll_timers``).

Claim boundary
--------------
* CPU-only Python oracle. Not the runtime C implementation.
* Does NOT prove a 1M-parked-vthread result; it proves the *structure* is
  O(log n) insert / O(1)-amortized cancel / O(k log n) expiry via an
  operation-count comparison against a naive sorted list.
* No wall-clock, no threads, no libpython. ``now`` is an explicit integer
  logical clock supplied by the caller, exactly as the C reference uses
  ``pcc_vthread_now_ms()`` snapshots.

Structure choice: binary min-heap keyed on ``(deadline, seq)`` with lazy
cancellation
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Two candidates were considered:

* **Binary min-heap** (chosen). Insert O(log n), extract-min O(log n),
  peek-min O(1). Cancellation is *lazy*: ``cancel(id)`` marks the entry dead in
  an O(1) side map and the dead entry is skipped (not paid for in ordering)
  when it surfaces at the root during ``expire_due``. This keeps the hot path
  (insert + expire) logarithmic regardless of how deadlines are distributed,
  and needs no assumption about the deadline range.

* **Hashed / hierarchical timing wheel** (added as a *second* oracle in this
  slice, see :class:`HashedTimingWheelTimerQueue`). A wheel gives O(1)
  insert/expire *amortized*, but only under a bounded, known tick granularity
  and a bounded max-timeout horizon; far-future deadlines need overflow lists /
  hierarchical wheels that cascade down at extra cost. The vthread sleep API
  (``py_virtual_thread_sleep(vt, delay_ms)``) takes an arbitrary ``delay_ms``
  and the poller is driven by irregular ``now`` snapshots rather than a fixed
  tick, so the wheel is built as a **hierarchical** wheel (Linux-kernel /
  Kafka-style): a fixed tick quantizes each level, and higher levels cascade
  their buckets down as the low-level wheel wraps, so an arbitrary ``delay_ms``
  and an arbitrary forward ``now`` jump both stay correct. It is validated to
  produce **byte-identical** expiry sequences to the min-heap (and to the naive
  baseline) on scripted + randomized cases, so the C slice may pick either
  structure behind one contract. The min-heap remains the first C mirror
  because it has no tick/horizon precondition and is a smaller correct mirror;
  the wheel is the documented next optimization once a fixed tick cadence
  exists (see ``docs/design/pcc-vthread-oracles.md``).

Semantics mirrored from the C reference (must not be weakened)
--------------------------------------------------------------
* Expiry order is nondecreasing by deadline. Among equal deadlines the C
  sorted list walks ``(*cur)->deadline_ms <= deadline_ms`` before inserting,
  i.e. FIFO among equal deadlines. The heap reproduces this with a monotonic
  insertion ``seq`` as the tiebreaker.
* ``expire_due(now)`` releases every entry with ``deadline <= now`` (the C loop
  breaks on ``entry->deadline_ms > now``), in nondecreasing deadline order.
* Root retention: an id stays registered (counts toward ``pending_count`` and
  can be cancelled) until it is either expired by ``expire_due`` or cancelled.
  This mirrors the C entry owning a GC root handle for the parked thread until
  the entry is freed.
* Done/cancelled skip: a cancelled entry surfacing at the root is dropped
  without being returned, mirroring the C poller's state check that skips a
  timer whose thread is no longer ``PCC_VTHREAD_PARKED``.

class HashedTimingWheelTimerQueue:
    """Hierarchical timing wheel: O(1)-amortized insert / advance.

    This is the *second* structure the C slice may adopt. It is a Linux-kernel /
    Kafka-style **hierarchical** wheel that stays correct under the vthread API's
    arbitrary ``delay_ms`` and irregular forward ``now`` snapshots (the min-heap's
    preconditions do not apply), and it is validated to produce **byte-identical**
    expiry sequences to :class:`MinHeapTimerQueue` and
    :class:`NaiveSortedListTimerQueue`.

    Structure
    ---------
    Everything is keyed on integer *ticks* of width ``tick``. Tick ``t`` covers
    the half-open real interval ``[t*tick, (t+1)*tick)``; a deadline ``d`` lives
    in tick ``d // tick``.

    * ``cur_tick`` is the wheel's current logical tick (``base = cur_tick*tick``
      is the time floor). Level 0 is a wheel of ``slots`` buckets covering ticks
      ``[cur_tick, cur_tick + slots)``. Level ``L`` covers ``slots**(L+1)`` ticks
      at ``slots**L`` ticks per bucket, and *overflows* one bucket down into the
      lower levels each time the lower wheel wraps. Levels are created lazily, so
      an arbitrary far-future ``delay_ms`` never overflows a fixed horizon.
    * ``expire_due(now)`` advances ``cur_tick`` toward ``now // tick`` one tick
      at a time. Each tick the clock *leaves behind* has its level-0 bucket
      unconditionally due (the whole tick is in the past). At the final,
      possibly partial, tick (``now`` mid-tick) the current bucket is drained
      keeping entries whose exact ``deadline > now`` (Kafka/Linux-kernel wheel
      discipline; exact deadlines are preserved, ticks only bucket them).

    Membership / cancellation / reschedule are handled exactly like the heap: an
    authoritative ``timer_id -> (deadline, seq)`` live map is the source of
    truth, and a bucket entry is *stale* (skipped, not returned) if it does not
    match the live map. This gives O(1) cancel and reschedule with no wheel walk.

    FIFO among equal deadlines
    --------------------------
    A bucket can hold entries that resolve to the same absolute deadline but were
    inserted at different times or cascaded from different levels, so relying on
    bucket-append order alone would not match the heap's ``(deadline, seq)``
    tiebreak. ``expire_due`` therefore collects the due live entries for the pass
    and returns them ordered by ``(deadline, seq)`` -- identical to the heap's
    ``k`` extract-mins -- guaranteeing exact parity.

"""CPU-only oracle for the virtual-thread IO waitset abstraction.

This module is an ORACLE, not the runtime. It designs and validates the
readiness model that a later C slice will mirror, replacing the current
per-poll O(n) linked-list scan in ``pcc/py_runtime/src/pcc_threads.c``
(``pcc_vthread_poll_add_locked`` prepends to ``pcc_vthread_poll_queue``;
``py_virtual_thread_poll_io`` walks the whole list calling ``poll(2)`` per
entry via ``pcc_vthread_fd_ready``).

Claim boundary
--------------
* CPU-only Python oracle. Not the runtime C implementation.
* The real ``kqueue``/``epoll`` integration is NOT implemented here; the
  platform path reports :class:`SkippedReason` (``SKIPPED_WITH_REASON``).
* No real sockets/fds, no syscalls, no threads. Readiness is fed explicitly
  through :meth:`set_ready` so the two waitset implementations can be diffed
  deterministically. ``now`` is an explicit logical clock, matching how the C
  poller reads ``pcc_vthread_now_ms()`` snapshots.
* Does NOT prove a 1M-fd result; it proves the poll-fallback and the
  kqueue-style readiness model agree on the same readiness sequence and honor
  add/remove/timeout invariants.

Two readiness models, one abstraction
--------------------------------------
Both implement :class:`IOWaitSet`:

* :class:`PollWaitSet` — the *level-triggered* fallback. On each
  :meth:`wait`, it re-scans every registered fd against its current readiness
  mask, mirroring the C poll-per-entry loop. As long as an fd stays readable
  and is still registered, every ``wait`` reports it. This is the semantics of
  ``poll(2)``/``select`` and of the current C runtime.

* :class:`KqueueSimWaitSet` — a pure-Python simulation of a readiness-notifier
  (kqueue/epoll) supporting BOTH level- and edge-triggered filters. It keeps a
  pending-event set that a readiness *transition* populates. In level mode it
  behaves exactly like the poll fallback (re-arms while ready), so the two
  agree. In edge mode a readiness event is delivered once per transition.

Event flags mirror the POSIX ``poll`` bits the C runtime uses
(``POLLIN``/``POLLOUT`` plus the always-reported error bits
``POLLERR``/``POLLHUP``/``POLLNVAL``), so a later C slice can map them onto
kqueue filters (``EVFILT_READ``/``EVFILT_WRITE``) without redefining semantics.

Level vs edge, made observable (persistent registrations)
---------------------------------------------------------
The default registration is *one-shot* (``oneshot=True``): the fd is unregistered
the moment it is delivered, mirroring the current C poller's park/unpark. That
model cannot *show* the level-vs-edge distinction, because a fd never survives to
a second ``wait``. Registering with ``oneshot=False`` keeps the fd across
deliveries, exposing the defining semantics:

* level (``PollWaitSet``, or ``KqueueSimWaitSet`` without ``edge``): a fd that
  stays ready and registered is re-reported on *every* ``wait`` until it is
  drained (:meth:`clear_ready`) or removed. This is exactly what CPython's
  level-triggered ``selectors``/``poll(2)`` does — an unread readable fd shows up
  on each ``select`` call.
* edge (``KqueueSimWaitSet`` with ``edge=True``): a persistently-ready fd fires
  *once* per false->true transition. Staying ready does not re-fire; the fd must
  be cleared and set again to fire a second time.

So for a persistently-ready, non-one-shot fd, level delivers on every wait while
edge delivers exactly once — the two intentionally *disagree*, which is the point
of the distinction.

EINTR / spurious-wakeup retry parity
------------------------------------
A real ``poll``/``kevent`` can return early with no events because a signal
interrupted the syscall (``EINTR``) or the kernel woke the thread spuriously.
Under PEP 475 CPython auto-retries on ``EINTR``, so from the caller's view an
interrupted wait simply returns *empty* and the caller loops again. The invariant
a correct waitset must preserve: an interrupted wait consumes nothing — no
readiness is drained, no deadline is treated as expired, no fd is unregistered —
so the retried wait sees exactly the same pending state and delivers each event
exactly once (never lost, never doubled). :meth:`IOWaitSet.wait` models this via
``interrupted=True``, and both waitset models must agree on the resulting
sequence.

"""Compiler-recognized virtual-thread helpers.

The pcc Python frontend lowers the scheduling operations natively.  ``call``
is also useful as an executable host-model adapter: under CPython it performs a
plain call, while pcc transparently delegates a returned parking continuation.
All scheduler operations still trap outside pcc lowering.

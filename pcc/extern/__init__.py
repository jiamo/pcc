"""pcc ``extern "C"`` FFI declarations (P6C.1).

The self-hosting roadmap (``docs/plans/python-frontend-plan.md``
§Phase 6C.1) requires that compiled Python be able to declare and
call arbitrary C library entry points directly, without going
through CPython or any other interpreter. This module hosts the
type markers and the ``extern()`` factory that pcc's codegen
recognizes.

Runtime status (2026-05-12): **codegen has landed**. The frontend
records ``extern()`` calls into ``L1CodeGen._extern_decls`` (see
``pcc/py_frontend/codegen/layer1.py::_emit_extern_call``); a call
through an extern lowers to a direct LLVM ``call`` to the named
external symbol with the declared C ABI. There is **no Python /
``py_obj_*`` trampoline** — the emitted asm is just ``bl <symbol>``
plus the int truncate/extend conversions performed by
``_coerce_to_extern``.

Known sharp edges still under P6C.1:

* ``c_str`` **argument**: pcc's ``str`` value is a ``PyStrObject*``,
  but the extern declaration expects a raw ``char*``. The current
  codegen passes the ``PyStrObject*`` through unchanged (see
  ``_coerce_to_extern`` line ~13483). For libc symbols that read
  bytes (``access``, ``getenv``, ...) this is wrong unless the
  callee happens to skip the header — most callers go through a
  helper that materialises a NUL-terminated buffer first.
* ``c_str`` **return**: extern functions returning ``char*`` (e.g.
  ``getenv``) hand back raw ``i8*``. There is no runtime helper
  yet that wraps the result into a ``PyStrObject``; the pcc-side
  caller currently has to raise ``NotImplementedError``. See
  ``pcc/py_stdlib/os.py::getenv`` for the canonical "blocked on
  string-return marshalling" stub.
* **Errno**: extern calls do not raise Python-level exceptions on
  failure; the C return contract is the only signal (``-1`` +
  ``errno`` for libc). Wrappers that want ``OSError`` semantics
  must inspect errno explicitly.

Example::

    printf: extern = extern(
        "printf",

        variadic=True,
    )

    def main() -> None:
        printf(c_str("hello\\n"))

"""Threading behavior compatibility scenarios for pcc.

The scenarios are intentionally tiny and deterministic.  They are used by tests
and by future CI scripts to compare pcc's native-threading shim with host
CPython behavior without relying on fixture-file spam.

Only scenarios that exercise CPython-portable surfaces are included. The
``threading.local`` shim in ``pcc/py_stdlib/threading.py`` exposes an explicit
``get`` / ``set`` / ``delete`` API which has no CPython counterpart, so it is
not tested via host parity here; see ``tests/test_threading_local.py`` for the
shim's own coverage.

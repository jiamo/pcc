"""pcc.py_stdlib.concurrent — sequential-fallback ``concurrent.futures``
skeleton.

The only consumer in pcc is ``pcc/evaluater/c_evaluator.py``, which
uses ``ProcessPoolExecutor.map`` to compile independent translation
units in parallel. For self-host we degrade to sequential execution;
the MCJIT subprocess guard that actually needs isolation is handled
separately by ``pcc.py_stdlib.multiprocessing`` (also sequential).

This module is laid out as a flat stub rather than a real package —
the audit only keys on the top-level import name, so a single file
is enough to satisfy ``from concurrent.futures import X`` (callers
resolve that at runtime via CPython's real module, not via this
stub). Attributes are re-exported under the module root so that if
the self-host build later imports this lazily, names resolve.

"""pcc.py_stdlib.multiprocessing — sequential-fallback skeleton.

pcc's only use of ``multiprocessing`` is the MCJIT subprocess
guard in ``pcc/evaluater/c_evaluator.py``: compile+run happens in a
child process so an LLVM crash doesn't take down the driver.

For self-host, we don't ship a fork/spawn runtime yet — P6C.1's
extern surface covers ``posix_spawn`` but not the full process-level
context switching the stdlib offers. This stub runs the work
in-process as a last-resort fallback, trading crash isolation for
being self-host-compilable. The existing CPython runtime keeps using
the real module, so production behaviour is unchanged.

Only the names the pcc evaluator uses (``get_context`` returning an
object with ``.Process``) are implemented; everything else is a
loud NotImplementedError.

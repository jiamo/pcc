"""The shared-state surface every L1CodeGen mixin may rely on.

`L1CodeGen` composes 86 mixin classes over one `self` namespace. Until now the
state those mixins read from `self` was implicit: a mixin could reach for
`self.builder` or `self.current_function` with nothing declaring that the
attribute exists, who sets it, or when it is valid. This module makes that
surface explicit (ARCH-P3-LAYER1-STATE-PROTOCOL).

This is a declaration, not a mechanism: nothing enforces it at runtime, and
composing it changes no behavior. Its job is to give the mixins one place that
answers "what am I allowed to assume about `self`?", and to give reviewers a
diff to look at when that assumption set grows.

The attribute list is measured, not guessed — it is the set of non-underscore
`self.<attr>` reads across `codegen/*_lowering.py` and `codegen/native_*.py`,
ordered by how many read sites each has.

    # and pcc1 answered "no-libpython function unavailable:
    # ...run_worker_commands", turning the whole function into an unavailable
    # stub.  That failure was silent -- stage2's export phase simply did
    # nothing, produced zero IR modules, and the first visible symptom was the
    # linker reporting no inputs.  Keep new primitives out of this file.

    # `wait -n` is also unavailable: macOS ships bash 3.2 where it does not
    # exist.  Instead each child records its status as a file in a directory
    # the caller already owns, and the launcher polls the count -- one `sh`
    # process, no FIFO, no temp module.

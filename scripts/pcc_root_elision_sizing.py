"""Size the allocation-point root-elision domain on real parsed IR.

Design-stage gate for the `S-P1-ALLOCATION-POINT-ROOT-ELISION` task row: a
read-only count of `pcc_gc_store_root` sites whose window — from the store to
the last reload of the SLOT — provably contains no allocation point.  It runs
on the same `ParsedModule`/CFG the precise stack-map analysis consumes, so the
number is what the real transform would see, but it changes nothing and is not
part of the compiled stage1 closure.

Two scan lessons are baked in (both produced wrong numbers before):

* Windows are keyed on the SLOT's reloads, not the rooted value.  Root codegen
  reloads from the slot after the store — that is what a root is for — so a
  value-keyed scan finds no uses and reports a vacuous 100%.
* Block-local scanning is structurally blind: every call is followed by a
  `py_err_occurred` branch, so every window crosses blocks.

The count is a sound, path-insensitive lower bound: region R is every block
reachable from the store block that can still reach a reload block, and the
store block's remainder plus every full block of R must be free of calls
outside the whitelist.  v1 restriction: only single-store slots (the rewrite
can then replace reloads with one SSA value without PHI construction).

The v1 whitelist deliberately EXCLUDES pcc_gc_release/py_decref: a release
reaching refcount zero dispatches `__del__`, and a finalizer can allocate.

"""Sample a running pcc binary and attribute self time to its own functions.

Why this exists
---------------
pcc1 carries ~14k text symbols, so function-level attribution needs no DWARF.
What repeatedly produced *confidently wrong* profiles was resolving addresses
against the wrong symbol table.  Two ways that happened here:

* an `nm` dump from a different build of the same day -- two such tables shared
  only their first 3 entries, and the profile claimed `fseek` was 10% of a
  workload that never seeks;
* sampling a `gtimeout`/`sh` wrapper instead of the compiler, then resolving its
  frames against pcc1 -- `__sigsuspend` came out as `_pcc_platform_waitpid` at
  53%, and there was no signal that anything was wrong.

So this script refuses to guess.  It reads the sampled process's own executable,
checks it against the image `sample` actually reports, derives the slide from
that image's load address rather than assuming one, and counts only frames
belonging to that image.  ``--binary`` is a *check*, not an override: a mismatch
is an error, because a mismatch is exactly the bug.

"""Integer-arithmetic security semantics for the C frontend.

Source: *Low-Level Software Security for Compiler Developers*, "Memory
vulnerability based attacks" — integer overflow / truncation / signedness are
the foundation of a huge fraction of memory-corruption primitives (a size
computation that wraps, a length truncated on the way into ``memcpy``, a
signed index that compares "in range" after promotion). The compiler must
lower these with the exact semantics C mandates so that defensive checks the
programmer writes actually hold.

pcc lowers ``int`` and ``unsigned int`` to LLVM ``i32`` and tracks signedness
separately (see AGENTS.md "C Codegen Invariants — Signedness"); these tests
exercise the boundary cases that a signedness-metadata-loss bug would corrupt.

``CEvaluator().evaluate`` compiles ``main`` and returns its exit code; each
case returns ``0`` exactly when the security-relevant invariant holds.

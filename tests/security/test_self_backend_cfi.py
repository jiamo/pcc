"""AArch64 branch-protection (pac-ret + BTI) in the pcc *self* backend.

Context (SEC-P1-CFI / S-track)
------------------------------
The LLVM execution path hardens emitted AArch64 code with pointer
authentication and branch-target identification via IR function attributes
(``pcc/codegen/c_codegen.py::_AARCH64_BRANCH_PROTECTION_ATTRS``), covered by
``tests/security/test_c_stack_protection.py::
test_control_flow_protection_pac_or_bti_emitted``.

The ``self`` backend is a first-class execution root and must not depend on
LLVM for control-flow-integrity hardening. Before SEC-P1-CFI a
``--backend self`` binary emitted *zero* return-address signing and *zero*
forward-edge landing pads (``paciasp`` count 0), leaving ROP/JOP unmitigated on
the self-backed root. These tests prove the self backend now emits, in its own
prologue/epilogue lowering:

* ``paciasp`` at function entry (sign LR with SP as modifier; keyed with the A
  key, matching the LLVM path's ``a_key``). ``paciasp`` is also a valid ``BTI
  c`` landing pad, so it provides the forward-edge target for ``bl``/``blr``
  callers.
* ``autiasp`` before ``ret`` in the epilogue (authenticate the signed LR).

The tests inspect the *emitted assembly* (and, when tools are available, the
*disassembled machine code*), because that is the layer an attacker faces.
They also assemble and run the hardened binary to prove the signing/auth pair
does not corrupt the frame or return path.

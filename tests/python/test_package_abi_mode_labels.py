"""PKG-P0-ABI-MODE-LABELS regression coverage.

Every package import/linkage result produced by ``linkage_report`` must carry
explicit execution-mode labels so an A-mode (libpython / cpython-compat)
compatibility SUCCESS can never silently promote to a B-mode (no-libpython /
pcc-native) package claim.

Claim boundary under test: a libpython/auto compatibility success reports
``execution_mode == "cpython-compat"`` with ``native_package_claim is False``;
the identical CPython-ABI artifact is rejected with a PCC-PKG-004 diagnostic
under pcc-native mode and still never earns ``native_package_claim``.

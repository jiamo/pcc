"""Ratchet on the atomics mirror between the C runtime and the pcc-Python ports.

History: until 2026-08-02 `pcc.unsafe` had no atomic intrinsic, so a port
reached atomics only through seven fixed C helpers in
`py_runtime_high_substrate.c` that pick memory ordering BY OPERAND WIDTH,
not by use (measured in
docs/goal/evidence/2026-08-01-atomics-mirror-gap-measured.md).

The intrinsic half of LIBC-P1-PRIMITIVES landed: `pcc.unsafe` now has
ordering-explicit `atomic_load/store/rmw/cas_{i32,i64}` plus `atomic_fence`
(tests/python/test_unsafe_atomics.py proves both backends). What this file
ratchets now:

1. the C runtime must not grow an atomic operation kind or a memory
   ordering the intrinsic surface cannot express;
2. the i8 byte-flag ops gained their intrinsic mirror on 2026-08-02
   (`atomic_test_and_set`/`atomic_clear` lower to `atomicrmw xchg i8` /
   `store atomic i8` on both backends) — every C atomic op kind is now
   expressible through `pcc.unsafe`, and the gap set must stay empty;
3. the legacy width-ordered C helpers were removed after the ports moved to
   ordering-explicit intrinsics; they must not reappear on either side.

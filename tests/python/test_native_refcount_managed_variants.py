"""Container retain/release parity under the refcount, generational and
relocating collectors.

History: this file was written to gate a `py_incref_managed`/`py_decref_managed`
ABI that skipped the raw-pointer provenance walk for values loaded from
container slots.  That ABI was DENIED (2026-08-27): the pcc1 built with it
segfaulted 3 s into Stage2 in `pcc_allocator_take_small_object` with a
corrupted free-list pointer (0x040000000111a5e9), because a container slot in
pcc-compiled code is not guaranteed to hold a managed object -- dyn values can
carry raw C pointers.  The ABI is gone; the behavioural gate stays, because it
is exactly the check that would have caught the defect before a stage did:
dict/list/tuple/instance/compare/set retain paths under GC0/GC3/GC4 with
collection forced between operations, plus a finalizer round-trip that turns
refcount drift in either direction into a wrong count.

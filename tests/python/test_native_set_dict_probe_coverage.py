"""A set/dict must never lose an element while a free slot exists.

``py_set``/``py_dict`` probe with CPython's perturb recurrence
``j = (j * 5 + perturb + 1) & mask`` and bounded the loop at ``capacity * 2``
probes.  That bound is not sufficient: ``perturb`` needs **13** shifts to decay
from a 64-bit value to zero, and only once it is zero does the recurrence
become a full-period generator over the table (a=5, c=1, m=2**k satisfies
Hull-Dobell).  At capacity 8 that left three full-period probes.

A run of **negative pointer-aligned** keys is the worst case: they all start at
the same slot, and the sequence could then oscillate over a handful of slots
until the budget ran out — with free slots never visited.  The element was then
dropped **with no error**.

Measured before the fix, at capacity 8 inserting -48 after -8..-40::

    probe slots visited:    [0, 7, 3, 7, 3, 7, 3, 7, 3, 7, 3, 7, 3, 0, 1, 6]
    distinct slots reached: {0, 1, 3, 6, 7}
    table:                  [-8, -16, None, -40, None, None, -24, -32]

Both the pcc-Python port and the C mirror had it, so host-side tests could
never see it: host pcc runs on CPython's own containers.

Why it mattered: frame offsets are negative and pointer-aligned, so
``active_offsets`` in the precise stack-map planner is exactly this shape.  A
dropped offset made a live GC root look inactive and rejected 19 functions
during Stage2.  See
``docs/investigations/pcc1-stage2-stale-managed-self-outlives-root.md``.

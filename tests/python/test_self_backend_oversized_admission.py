"""Memory-aware width-2 admission waves for the oversized emit lane.

The oversized lane ran its multi-GiB workers strictly serially (164.8 s over
7 items on the 2026-08-27 receipts).  Input bytes track peak footprint at
~1.3-1.4 GB/MB, so a 7 MB concurrent-input-byte cap admits every measured
pair at <= 7.2 GB while keeping the two giants (and the giant with anything)
apart.  ``pack_admission_waves`` is first-fit-decreasing over per-command
byte weights; ``run_emit_worker_pool`` weighs each command from its OWN
batch contents because ``_pack_batches`` reorders items by descending bytes
(the caller's ``item_bytes`` list does not align with command order).

"""Function bodies must survive the merge byte-identically.

Comparing whole `__text` payloads against `ld -r` reports a difference, and
the first read of that was "placement or addend detail". Bisecting showed the
first differing byte is an *instruction* inside a function — with identical
section sizes, meaning the two linkers placed different functions there.

Slicing `__text` by symbol and comparing bodies is the measurement that
actually answers the question: ld -r reorders atoms, pcc concatenates in
input order, and every function body is identical. This pins that — a real
corruption would change a body, not just its address.

The slicing itself needed one correction: several symbols can share an
address (aliases), and slicing per *symbol* gave the second name at an
address a zero-length body, which then "differed". `_fabs` and `_pow` were
reported that way before the slice was keyed on distinct addresses. Two of
the measurement artifacts in this file's history were in the harness, not
the linker; that is why the checks say what they measure.

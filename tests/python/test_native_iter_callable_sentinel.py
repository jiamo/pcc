"""Native 2-arg ``iter(callable, sentinel)`` lowering (no libpython).

CPython's ``iter(callable, sentinel)`` returns a callable-iterator: each
``next()`` calls ``callable()`` and yields the result until it compares equal
to ``sentinel``, at which point ``StopIteration`` is raised (the sentinel value
itself is not yielded). pcc lowers this natively onto the existing
``PY_TYPE_ITER`` object (the single ``seq`` slot holds a ``(callable, sentinel)``
tuple; the ``index`` field is a negative state discriminator), so the whole
construct stays libpython-free.

Compiling in default mode links the pcc-Python runtime ports and hard-errors on
any libpython fallback, so a successful compile+run here proves the native
callable-iterator path is exercised end to end. Output is diffed against the
CPython reference for the exact same source.

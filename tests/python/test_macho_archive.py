"""Archive reading and member selection, checked against `ar` and `nm`.

Two properties matter and neither is structural:

1. **Only what is needed gets pulled.** An archive member nobody references
   must not enter the link — otherwise every binary carries the whole runtime.
2. **The scan repeats.** A member pulled late can reference a symbol defined
   by a member *earlier* in the archive; a single forward pass walks past it
   and leaves the symbol undefined. The archive below is built so that a
   one-pass linker fails and a repeated-scan one succeeds.

The real runtime archive (`libpy_runtime_pcc_py.a`, ~2.9MB, BSD extended
names, `__.SYMDEF SORTED` index) is parsed too, so the format handling is not
only exercised on toys.

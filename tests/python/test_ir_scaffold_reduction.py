"""Phase 5 readiness check: ON mode reduces fallback count on a
synthetic layer1-shaped source.

This test gives Path A its first quantitative win: a small-but-realistic
program that mixes ``self.builder.X(...)`` calls and
``self.runtime[...]`` lookups (the two top idiom clusters from the
probe report) compiles to strictly fewer ``py_cpy_*`` calls in ON mode
than in OFF mode.

Once Task 20 starts migrating real frontend files, the assertions here
become a sanity check: if a synthetic file's reduction drops, something
broke the dispatch.

"""PKG-P0-INSTALL-IMPORT-SEPARATION regression gate.

`pcc1 -m pip install` may fetch/place a real package or wheel, but install
success must NEVER imply import success, pcc-native ABI support, or
no-libpython package support. These tests pin the install manifest so that a
reader can tell those claims apart: install_success is recorded separately from
import_attempted / import_success (import is a distinct, un-run gate), and a
CPython-ABI wheel install records its wheel/ABI tags WITHOUT ever setting a
pcc-native package claim.

The install flow is exercised in-process via ``pcc.package.install`` (no real
pcc1 binary shell-out) with tiny wheel fixtures built in a tmp dir. The point is
the honesty of the manifest fields, not any single package.

"""package_site_roots must not re-resolve the package environment per call.

The stage2 coordinator profile attributed 34% of its sampled window to
resolve_pcc_native_extension_path, whose every call re-ran
resolve_package_environment (13 env reads + environment.json open/read/parse)
via package_site_roots.  The roots are a pure function of the environment
fingerprint; the per-call filesystem PROBES (isdir/isfile/listdir) stay live
so freshly installed packages are still found within one process.

    module, which is a runtime extern not callable from interpreted
    Python). A full-behavior smoke test would have to compile-and-run a
    program under pcc; that path is covered by other native threading
    tests once the no-libpython pipeline can lower per-thread dict
    storage. For now we lock the API surface so the patch cannot be

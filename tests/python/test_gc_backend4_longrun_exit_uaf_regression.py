"""G-P0-LONGRUN regression: backend #4 exit-time stale slot-value UAF.

This is the closure regression for
``docs/investigations/gc-backend4-churn-exit-list-item-uaf.md``. The
historical failure boundary is intentionally mode-labeled:

* strict Python frontend mode: ``backend=self``, ``python-libpython=off``,
  ``ir-scaffold=on``
* runtime mode: ``PCC_GC_BACKEND=4``
* workload: ``longrun_churn.py`` completes ALL work (prints ``done,<ops>``)
  and then dies with SIGSEGV during exit-time list deallocation, at
  ~2/3 of runs, on backend #4 only (backends 0-3 are clean).

Root cause (No.6/No.9 in the investigation): the backend-4 read barrier
decided "does this slot value need relocation resolution?" by loading the
value's header flags directly. Under churn a slot can hold a STALE reference
(a freed malloc'd child, or an old copy whose address the object index /
forwarding table never mapped). The address heuristic cannot tell a
plausible-but-unmapped address apart from a live one, so the header load
faulted at exit-time list dealloc.

The fix routes the backend-4 decision through
``pcc_gc_backend4_slot_needs_resolve`` (py_gc_backend.c + pcc-Python mirror),
which consults the forwarding table and object index (pointer-VALUE hash
lookups, no deref) FIRST and only reads the header of a proven-mapped
(known-live) object.

CPython reference (``python3 longrun_churn.py 600`` semantics): prints
``done,38400`` (600 rounds x 64 ops) and exits 0, no ``corrupt`` line.

Because the historical crash was intermittent (~2/3), a single lucky pass
cannot prove the fix. This runs the compiled binary REPEATEDLY under
``PCC_GC_BACKEND=4`` and requires every attempt to reach ``done,`` and exit
cleanly. It does NOT weaken the gate to green it (AGENTS.md / investigation
Notes): a stale-slot-value read must resolve or pass through without a fault,
never by disabling relocation, dropping GC tracking, or short-circuiting the
dealloc walk.

"""Dict-literal owned-temp release regressions (2026-06-12).

Two frontend ownership leaks made steady-state churn grow RSS without
bound (found by the G-P3 long-run harness, attributed via leaks(1)):

1. ``_emit_dict_literal`` (all three emission sites: exact-int branch,
   general branch, splat) called ``py_dict_set``/``py_dict_update`` —
   which BORROW (balanced ``pcc_gc_store_ptr``) — without releasing
   owned key/value temps, leaking one object per stored owned temp.
   The list/tuple literal paths released; dict did not.
2. ``_raw_scaffold_object_rhs_is_owned`` was missing ``str``/``bytes``
   in its builtin-constructor set, so ``s = str(x)`` in a module that
   imports ``pcc.extern`` skipped owned-local management and leaked the
   previous value on every rebind.

The runtime test proves the semantic (finalizers run == temps died) on
every GC backend; the IR test pins the raw-scaffold owned-local shape.

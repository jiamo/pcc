"""Module-level ``try``/``except`` must lower like the in-function form.

``@main`` and ``_pcc_py_module_top_*`` are IR functions, so module-level
statements need the same per-function reset of the exception-handler state that
``_emit_user_function`` does in its prologue. Without it a module-level ``try``
branched into whichever basic block the previously lowered function left in
``_try_err_block`` -- invalid IR, and invisible on the host because whether the
carried-over block happened to be ``None`` depended on lowering order.

That is why ``pcc1`` could not compile ``pcc/py_frontend/pipeline.py`` (it has a
module-level ``try`` at its ``PCC_DEBUG_RUNTIME`` probe) and stage2 could not run
at all, while the host compiler was green.

"""Phase G0 — GC semantics gap baseline.

Locks the current memory-model contract so future GC work has a known
starting line. These tests are live regression gates for behavior that
started as the Phase G0-G5 gap baseline. See
``docs/issues/gc-semantics-gap.md`` for the historical plan.

Test families:
- refcount / immortal / tagged-int
- cycle collection behavior
- ``__del__`` dispatch
- ``weakref`` behavior
- concurrent refcount no-drift probe; broader free-threaded coverage still
  lives in dedicated threading/GC tests.

"""Source lint for the L1CodeGen mixin composition.

`L1CodeGen` composes 86 mixins over one `self` namespace, so two mixins
defining the same private helper is resolved silently by the MRO — one
definition simply wins, and a later edit to the losing copy does nothing.
That is the failure this lint exists to prevent (ARCH-P3-LAYER1-STATE-PROTOCOL).

It also keeps `pcc/py_frontend/codegen/layer1_state.py` honest: the declared
shared-state surface must stay a superset of what the mixins actually read.

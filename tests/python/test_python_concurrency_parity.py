"""CPython-parity concurrency tests, ported from ``Lib/test/lock_tests.py``.

Each test below is a small, self-contained Python program adapted from
CPython's reusable lock-test framework. The original suite uses
``Bunch`` / ``wait_threads_blocked`` / ``self.assertEqual`` and other
test infrastructure that pcc cannot compile; the ports preserve the
*observable behaviour* CPython asserts but use plain ``print``-and-grep
assertions and avoid pcc's currently-known frontend gaps:

  * no list comprehensions of Threads (hits
    ``threads[i].start()`` codegen bug — see
    ``docs/investigations/threading-list-index-start-failure.md``)
  * no ``nonlocal`` (use module-level mutable container)
  * no ``with lock:`` in the contended cases yet (the pcc shim has
    ``__enter__`` / ``__exit__`` but exception-edge cases are still
    open in D4 from the data-model gap roadmap)

CPython's contract for each pattern:

  * **acquire/release roundtrip** — ``Lock`` is reusable after release
  * **contended counter** — ``N`` threads each running ``K`` increments
    under one ``Lock`` produce ``counter == N * K`` exactly
    (this is the canonical free-threaded sanity check)
  * **RLock recursion count** — the same thread can re-acquire an
    ``RLock`` arbitrarily many times; ``release`` must be called the
    same number of times before another thread can acquire
  * **Event broadcast** — ``N`` threads waiting on ``Event.wait``
    all return after a single ``set`` from the main thread

``::test_acquire_contended``, ``::test_recursion_count``,
``::test_set_and_clear``.

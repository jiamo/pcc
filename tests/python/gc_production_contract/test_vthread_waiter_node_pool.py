"""5-GC common production contract: vthread waiter-node freelist pool.

Part of the virtual-thread T-track (T-P0-VTHREAD-NODE-POOL) and the 5-GC
Production Equality Rule (docs/goal/goal-prompt.md G-track). py_threading.c wakes
virtual threads that block on a Lock / Event / Condition / Semaphore through a
per-object waiter queue whose nodes (PyThreadVThreadWaiter) used to be raw
calloc()/free() per park. This slice recycles those nodes through a bounded
slab/freelist pool (PCC_VTHREAD_WAITER_POOL_LIMIT), mirroring the ready-entry
pool in pcc_threads.c (PCC_VTHREAD_READY_ENTRY_POOL_LIMIT).

The waiter-node path is a runtime ABI surface rather than a Python source
construct, so this brick builds a focused C probe against pcc's no-libpython
runtime archive and runs the same probe under PCC_GC_BACKEND 0..4.

The probe spawns many virtual threads that each try to acquire one shared
threading.Lock while running on the scheduler. Only one holds it at a time; the
rest enqueue waiter nodes and park. A releaser vthread hands the lock along one
waiter at a time until every worker has acquired and released it. Running this
over many rounds forces the freelist to fill and be reused. The pool must
preserve the observable contract: every worker eventually acquires the lock
(mutual exclusion, FIFO wake, no lost wakeups), the scheduler queues drain to
empty, and no waiter node leaks — identically across all five GC backends.

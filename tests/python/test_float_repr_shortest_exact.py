"""``repr(float)`` must be the shortest string that round-trips.

pcc1 printed `4503599627370496.0` (exactly 2**52) as `4503599627370499.9`, and
`float(str(v))` then gave a third value. The stored double was fine — `int(v)`
and `v == 2**52` both agreed — so only the decimal *formatting* was wrong.

That single literal is the one `pcc/stdlib/_float_bits.py` scales by to extract
a mantissa, so a pcc-built compiler inherited the error: `1000.0` came out as
`0x408F400000000004` instead of `0x408F400000000000`, which needs one extra
`movk` to materialise. Across 13 numeric/time-formatting functions that is +100
bytes of `__TEXT,__text`, which is exactly why `cmp pcc2 pcc3` failed and the
five-GC bootstrap matrix was red on all five backends.

"""Unbound ``KnownClass.method(self)`` call regressions.

numpy ``distutils/fcompiler/gnu.py`` failed to compile with "too many
positional args: got 1, expected at most 0" on
``GnuFCompiler.get_flags(self)``: ``get_flags`` is inherited from the
CPython-backed ``FCompiler`` base, so the native MRO walk found nothing
and the lowering fell through to the "any class declaring the method"
name-scan fallback — which matched the SUBCLASS's same-named method and
treated the class object as a bound instance receiver. The fix routes
unresolvable ``KnownClass.method(...)`` calls through dynamic
getattr-on-the-class + call with all explicit args (CPython
unbound-call semantics).

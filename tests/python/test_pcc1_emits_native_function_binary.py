"""pcc1 must lower a function definition all the way to a running binary.

Every other pcc1 gate stops at ``--emit-llvm``, so the self-backend emit path
was never exercised *from pcc1* -- only from the host.  That gap let pcc1 ship
unable to compile any program containing a ``def``: the emitter's
stack-map planner cached location tuples under ``id()`` keys without keeping
the keyed objects alive, so a freed ``_RootGroup`` whose address was reused
made a stale fingerprint HIT and return a wrong tuple.  The host kept those
groups alive incidentally and never reproduced it.

The distinguishing input is tiny: a module with no function has no phi node and
compiled fine, while ``def f(): pass`` already has one.

    `PCC_HOST_PYTHON` is deliberately NOT disabled here.  A pcc1 compile still
    invokes the runtime-archive `make`, and that make shells out to a host
    Python for `pcc.tools.ir_to_obj`; disabling it makes the rebuild fail AND
    delete the objects it was rebuilding, so each run corrupts the archive a
    little further and the failure moves to a different object.  Removing host
    Python from the build path is its own goal, tracked separately -- this gate
    is about pcc1 lowering a function definition to a running binary, and
    conflating the two just produced a red test with a misleading message.

    The RUN step below still asserts no-host-python behaviour, which is where
    that claim actually belongs.

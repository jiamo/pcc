"""Line information for Python-frontend builds.

The Python frontend emitted no debug info at all, so a pcc-compiled program
could only be debugged by rebuilding it with print statements.  These tests
pin the three things that made the feature silently produce nothing during
development: the flag has to survive the CLI's Python branch, the locations
have to survive the IR pass pipeline, and the metadata has to be valid enough
that LLVM keeps the compile unit instead of discarding it with a warning.

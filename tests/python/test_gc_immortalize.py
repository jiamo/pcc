"""Regression coverage for ``gc.immortalize`` (pcc_gc_immortalize).

The runtime's ``PY_FLAG_IMMORTAL`` early-return existed in
py_incref/py_decref but nothing user-facing could set it. ``gc.immortalize``
is pcc's native equivalent of the ``PyUnstable_Object_SetImmortal`` escape
free-threaded CPython 3.14 added for NumPy's shared-singleton refcount
contention (labs.quansight.org/blog/scaling-numpy-on-free-threaded-python).

Two behaviors are pinned:

  1. An immortalized object is never deallocated: a ``__del__`` canary must
     NOT fire after the last reference is dropped.
  2. Under ``PCC_WITH_THREADS=1``, four threads hammering the refcount of an
     immortalized shared instance still compute correct results (the flag
     removes the refcount traffic; it must not corrupt the object).

Scaling itself is benchmarked by benchmarks/python/shared_refcount_
contention*.py and recorded in the investigation, not asserted here.

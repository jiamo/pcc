"""Concurrent-mutation correctness tests for pcc's ``threading.Lock``.

Companion file to the layered investigation in
``docs/investigations/threading-lock-lost-update.md``. Each test isolates
one rung of the layered bisect that pinned the lost-update bug to the
Python codegen path (the C-level ``pcc_mutex_lock`` and PyObject-API
paths serialize correctly; the pcc-Python ``lock.acquire()`` path
loses ~50% of updates at high contention).

Tests in this file:

  * ``test_pthread_lock_disjoint_slot_writes_succeed`` — control: when
    each thread writes to its own list slot under one Lock, no
    cross-thread RMW happens, so the test passes regardless of the
    Lock-mutual-exclusion bug. This is the "the threads do run in
    parallel" baseline.
  * ``test_pthread_lock_low_iter_count_succeeds`` — control: at one
    iter per thread, the contention window is tiny and the bug rarely
    triggers. Asserts the happy path still works.
  * ``test_pthread_lock_list_append_under_contention`` — repro for the
    SIGABRT case: many threads doing ``list.append(1)`` under one
    Lock crashes the runtime under high contention. Marked xfail-strict
    until the T0 fix in ``docs/plans/python-types-codex-roadmap.md``
    lands.

The shared-slot ``counts[0] = counts[0] + 1`` repro lives in
``tests/test_threading_module_native.py::test_pthread_lock_serializes_shared_list_updates``
to keep all native-threading tests reachable via that file's existing
runtime-archive setup. This file adds the surrounding contract.

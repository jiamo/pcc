"""The merge must not lose relocations — measured, not assumed.

A linker that silently drops a relocation produces a binary that runs until
the un-relocated address is used. This suite counts every section's
relocations across the inputs and across the merged output and requires them
equal, on the real job: pcc's own emitter output plus the runtime-archive
members its symbols pull (92 objects, ~62k relocations).

It exists because a per-section comparison against `ld -r` showed pcc with
half of ld's `__eh_frame` count, which was first written up as a pcc bug.
Counting inputs instead of comparing outputs showed pcc loses nothing and ld
*adds* entries by rewriting FDE/CIE structure. The lesson is the test: when
two tools disagree on a count, count the inputs before deciding who is wrong.

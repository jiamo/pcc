"""Regression: an unused extern declaration that defines a tag must survive.

``extern const struct T { double a; } g;`` does two things at once — it
declares ``g`` and it defines ``struct T``. ``ElimAvailExternPass`` used to
drop the whole declaration whenever ``g`` was not referenced in the same
translation unit, taking the tag body with it. Every later ``struct T`` then
resolved to an opaque identified type, so the object it typed was unsized and
LLVM aborted at object emission ("Cannot getTypeInfo() on a type that is
unsized!") — and before that point the object's initializer had already been
dropped to ``zeroinitializer``, which is silently wrong data rather than a
crash.

musl's ``exp_data.h`` and ``pow_data.h`` are written exactly this way, so the
vendored math tree carried a header split as a workaround
(BUG-P1-CC-EMBEDDED-TAG-IN-EXTERN-DECL-UNSIZED).

"""T-P0-VTHREAD-1M-GATE first slice — bounded virtual-thread scale MEASUREMENT
harness over a self-contained *logical* scheduler model.

This module is a **measurement harness**, not a scheduler, not the runtime, and
not a 1M-readiness claim. It exercises a small, self-contained in-harness model
of the three virtual-thread scheduler waitsets that the real C runtime
(``pcc/py_runtime/src/pcc_threads.c``) owns:

    * a ready queue          (enqueue / dequeue)           <- ``pcc_vthread_enqueue_locked`` / ``pcc_vthread_dequeue_locked``
    * a deadline-sorted timer (insert / expire)            <- ``pcc_vthread_timer_add_locked`` / ``py_virtual_thread_poll_timers``
    * an IO waitset          (add wait / mark ready)       <- ``pcc_vthread_poll_add_locked`` / ``py_virtual_thread_poll_io``

For each ``N`` virtual threads it reports **deterministic logical counters**
only:

    * ``enqueue_ops`` / ``dequeue_ops``          -- ready-queue logical op counts
    * ``timer_insert_ops`` / ``timer_expire_ops`` -- timer logical op counts
    * ``io_wait_add_ops`` / ``io_ready_ops``      -- io-waitset logical op counts
    * ``peak_live_set``                            -- an RSS *surrogate*: the max
      number of simultaneously-live logical scheduler nodes (NOT bytes, NOT RSS)
    * ``gc_pause_count``                           -- a GC-pause-count *surrogate*:
      how many times a bounded live-set threshold was crossed (NOT a real GC
      pause, NOT a latency)
    * ``carrier_count``                            -- the number of logical
      carrier queues the ready work is round-robin distributed across (mirrors
      ``pcc_vthread_carrier_count`` / ``pcc_vthread_carrier_queues`` in
      ``pcc_threads.c``)
    * ``carrier_max_load`` / ``carrier_min_load``  -- the most- and least-loaded
      carrier's round-robin enqueue count (mirrors the ``pcc_vthread_next_carrier_enqueue
      % pcc_vthread_carrier_queue_count`` push distribution)
    * ``carrier_load_imbalance``                   -- ``carrier_max_load -
      carrier_min_load``; a work-STEALING-imbalance logical COUNT (NOT a latency,
      NOT bytes). For a perfect round-robin it is 0 when the carrier count divides
      ``N`` and 1 otherwise.
    * ``work_steal_ops``                           -- a work-stealing *surrogate*:
      the number of ready nodes that fall beyond the even per-carrier floor share
      and would be stolen by an idle carrier (mirrors the
      ``(own + offset) % n_queues`` steal loop that bumps
      ``pcc_vthread_carrier_steal_count``). Equals ``N % carrier_count``; 0 iff the
      carrier count divides ``N`` (perfectly balanced) or there is a single
      carrier (all work stays local). A COUNT, never a rate.

Mode taxonomy (see :class:`VThreadMode`):

    * ``small-ci``      -> RUNS by default at a bounded ``N`` (default 10_000).
      Everything measured is a deterministic logical count over the in-harness
      model. No wall-clock, no RSS bytes, no latency.
    * ``large-manual``  -> N = 1_000_000. Does NOT run in CI. Gated OFF unless
      the environment variable ``PCC_VTHREAD_1M=1`` is set. Even when it runs it
      still only produces the same *logical* counters, not real RSS/latency.
    * ``real-runtime``  -> ALWAYS ``SKIPPED_WITH_REASON`` *in this logical
      entrypoint*. The separately gated ``scripts/run_vthread_1m_gate.py`` owns
      the live production-C-runtime measurement. This harness cannot relabel
      its logical counts as that result.

CLAIM BOUNDARY (read before citing any number this harness emits):

    A ``small-ci`` / ``large-manual`` result is a mode-labeled set of
    DETERMINISTIC LOGICAL COUNTS over a self-contained scheduler model running
    in ONE host Python process. ``peak_live_set`` is a live-node COUNT used as
    an RSS surrogate and ``gc_pause_count`` is a threshold-crossing COUNT used
    as a GC-pause surrogate. Neither is bytes, neither is time. This harness
    proves that the LOGICAL scheduler model's counters scale predictably with
    ``N`` and are deterministic. It does NOT prove 1M-vthread readiness, real
    RSS, real enqueue/dequeue/timer/IO latency, real GC pause behavior, or any
    virtual-thread performance completion. Those require the ``real-runtime``
    mode, which is always skipped here with an exact missing-capability reason.

Standalone-importable: ``import tests.benchmarks.vthread.harness``.

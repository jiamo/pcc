# PCC GPU Next Work Contract

Date: 2026-07-06

This document internalizes the GPU / GPU-GC / distributed / ds4 next-work
plan into the repository. It supersedes ad hoc chat notes for this route. The
source prompt read for this consolidation was
`~/Downloads/codex_pcc_gpu_next_work.md` on 2026-07-06, but that downloaded
file is not a runtime dependency; the durable authority is this document plus
`docs/goal/task-board.yaml`.

## Current State Calibration

The GPU route has moved past the first Metal demo:

- `pcc/kernel_ir/` defines a kernel-only IR boundary with PyObject escape
  rejection.
- TIRx-like freeze, TVM-shape projection, Metal source finalization, launch
  planning, host bridge artifacts, native MTLBuffer bindings, runtime-source
  command-buffer execution, CPU readback verification, and package manifests
  exist as separate claim layers.
- Runtime-source Metal execution is locally proven for a shaped copy kernel, a
  small imported TileLang scalar GEMM, strict static TileLang transposed
  scalar-GEMM variants (`transpose_A` with A(K,M), `transpose_B` with B(N,K),
  and combined transpose_A+transpose_B), `T.serial`/`T.Pipelined` start/end
  range syntax including nonzero K-loop starts for the current GEMM subset, a legal
  static finite POD `T.fill(buffer, value)` form with shared CPU/Metal dtype
  coercion (real device readback proven for f16/f32), a legal
  TileLang `T.Parallel` A/B/C tile-copy staging form, one-dimensional
  `T.vectorized` tile-copy staging metadata for the same subset, and a bounded
  canonical indexed elementwise assignment subset for static `T.Parallel`
  and one-dimensional `T.vectorized` loops (CPU oracle plus real
  runtime-source Metal readback), plus one fixed 5x7x16 f16/int16 2:4
  `T.gemm_sp` correctness shape lowered by pcc to scalar Metal metadata decode
  and proven by real f32 readback (not sparse-MMA or performance proof),
  `T.use_swizzle` no-op and enabled row/column threadblock rasterization
  metadata for scalar-GEMM tile mapping, empty
  `T.annotate_layout({})` no-op layout metadata, swizzled
  `T.annotate_layout({buf: make_swizzled_layout(buf)})` local-layout metadata
  with runtime-source Metal execution for rank-2 bank-swizzled and
  padded-fallback shared A/B tiles. The pinned TileLang
  `make_wgmma_swizzled_layout` helper is separately preserved with its
  `LayoutInference`/CUDA-SM90/WGMMA identity and rejected explicitly on Metal;
  it is not downgraded to the ordinary swizzle. Runtime execution also covers
  split-k f32 `T.atomic_add(C, C_local)`
  output accumulation for that scalar-GEMM subset including non-divisible K
  tails when the copy-index span is explicitly `T.ceildiv(K, split_k)`, and
  the first 8x8 simdgroup GEMM microkernel including enabled row/column
  `T.use_swizzle` tile remap on 2x2 and 3x2 tile grids plus nonzero K-loop
  range execution, divisible and non-8-wide/ceildiv split-k atomic f32 output
  accumulation, split-k atomic M/N edge tiles including a combined M/N-edge
  plus explicit ceildiv K-tail case, combined transposed A(K,M) / B(N,K)
  operand layouts, plus non-atomic M/N edge-tile and K-tail execution using
  zero-padded threadgroup staging, the first two-simdgroup-per-threadgroup
  N- and M-direction runtime-source shapes (`block_n=16` or `block_m=16`,
  `threads=64`), plus the first four-simdgroup 2-D runtime-source shape
  (`block_m=16`, `block_n=16`, `threads=128`) including the combined
  `transpose_A` / `transpose_B` operand-layout variant.
- One bounded dynamic-shape contract exists for a one-dimensional TileLang
  vector extent `N`. It validates resource/grid overflow and uses a
  source-and-bounds-complete cache identity before specializing through the
  strict importer to fully static Kernel IR. This is contract evidence only;
  no dynamic runtime dispatch or GPU execution is claimed.
- DLPack ownership now exports/imports a classic C-ABI `DLManagedTensor`
  through the real CPython `dltensor -> used_dltensor` capsule boundary,
  accepts foreign kDLMetal producers for contiguous/default-stream tensors,
  and defers the foreign deleter until a `PccFenceToken` completes. External
  torch/MLX/MPS round-trip, non-default stream synchronization, pcc1 capsules,
  and five-GC device execution remain separate gates.
- `pcc/dist/` and `tests/dist/` contain local session, sharding, KV, and
  collective oracles plus explicit no-fallback localhost TCP-ring and
  transport-collective owners. They are not multi-Mac execution, tensor/KV
  execution, or throughput/scaling proof.
- `pcc/gpu_gc/` remains CPU-only, but now includes a production-shaped external
  resource seam for GC backend labels 0..4: opaque `PccBufferHandle` resources,
  native release callbacks, and fence-deferred release. It is not yet wired into
  the C runtime or pcc-Python runtime GC backends.
- Offline `.air/.metallib` production remains blocked on this machine by the
  missing Xcode Metal Toolchain component.

Therefore the correct claim is:

```text
pcc has a host/device-split Kernel IR and selected runtime-source Metal device
result proofs. It does not have whole-program GPU execution, metallib-backed
launch proof, pcc1-native GPU launcher proof, five-GC GPU lifetime parity, full
TileLang/TVM pass execution, or ds4 support.
```

## Reference Trees

Reference source lives outside the repo under `~/pcc_refs` or the user's local
TileLang checkout. These are evidence/reference inputs only; they are not pcc
support claims.

| Reference | Path | Commit |
|---|---|---|
| LLVM 20.1.8 | `~/pcc_refs/llvm-project-20.1.8-full-depth1` | `87f0227cb60147a26a1eeb4fb06e3b505e9c7261` |
| Apache TVM | `~/pcc_refs/apache-tvm-full-depth1` | `cfb98e938c8d9525648c75fbebcb8944edb952fe` |
| TileLang | `~/tilelang` | `ed00dfcd7f9c200e1150896b1be59c41ff3e8d9d` |
| TileLang vendored TVM | `~/tilelang/3rdparty/tvm` | `1ecfcc2e1e1fb9f75db9ed760a97aa9687372905` |
| ds4 / DwarfStar | `~/pcc_refs/antirez-ds4-depth1` | `80ebbc396aee40eedc1d829222f3362d10fa4c6c` |

Do not copy these trees into `pcc/`. When using them for a task, record the
path and commit in the evidence for that task.

Reference-derived design rules:

- LLVM is a design reference for durable IR layering, target separation,
  verification, and pass boundaries. pcc retains semantic ownership of GPU
  behavior, while an explicitly selected backend may become the execution
  owner under `docs/design/pcc-gpu-owner-backends.md`.
- TVM and TileLang are references for schedule representation, TIR/TIRx
  structure, Metal codegen shapes, swizzle/layout idioms, and simdgroup GEMM
  lowering. Import only the semantics pcc can represent in Kernel IR and
  validate; fail closed for the rest.
- ds4 is an external oracle and migration target. Use it to inventory real
  C/Metal/KV/SSD/distributed pressure, not as proof that pcc supports ds4.

## Claim Levels

GPU evidence must be mode-labeled. Do not use a lower level as proof of a
higher one.

| Level | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `GPU_LEVEL_0_METADATA` | IR, descriptor, manifest, inventory, or oracle metadata only |
| `GPU_LEVEL_1_SOURCE` | `.metal` or host bridge source emitted and inspected |
| `GPU_LEVEL_2_ARTIFACT` | `.air`, `.metallib`, `.o`, `.dylib`, or symbol validation produced |
| `GPU_LEVEL_3_RUNTIME_ABI` | Host ABI invoked or packet packed; fake/injected calls are still not GPU execution |
| `GPU_LEVEL_4_DEVICE_RESULT` | Real command buffer submitted, fence completed, readback equals CPU oracle |
| `GPU_LEVEL_5_PCC1_NATIVE` | pcc1-built no-libpython binary runs the same launcher path |
| `GPU_LEVEL_6_5GC_PARITY` | Same workload/lifetime gate passes under `PCC_GC_BACKEND=0..4` |

`DONE_STRONG` for a GPU primitive requires at least:

- CPU oracle.
- Kernel IR / TIRx freeze / source golden.
- Packed argument rejection for PyObject, wrong dtype, wrong device, and wrong
  shape.
- `GPU_LEVEL_4_DEVICE_RESULT`.
- pcc1 no-libpython launcher proof.
- five-GC lifetime proof.
- toolchain/device absence represented as `SKIPPED_WITH_REASON`, not success.

## Canonical Lowering Path

The canonical route is:

```text
@pcc.gpu.kernel / TileLang-like source / ds4 adapter
  -> pcc Kernel IR
  -> validate_kernel()
  -> TIRx-compatible freeze
  -> target-specific finalize
  -> launch plan / package / runtime
```

`pcc.gpu_kernel` has no direct AST-to-Metal path. Its finite scalar/indexed
subset is imported as validated structured Kernel IR, and unsupported Python
syntax fails closed before TIRx/Metal finalization.

All TileLang and ds4 adapters must produce Kernel IR first. They must not call
TileLang/TVM runtime objects or ds4 GPU APIs as semantic owners. A pinned,
explicitly selected TVM/TileLang provider may later become an execution owner
behind the common GPU driver boundary; it still consumes pcc-validated frozen
IR and cannot silently replace pcc's semantic, ABI, or lifetime contracts.

## First-class GPU execution owners

The durable owner-backend contract is
[`pcc-gpu-owner-backends.md`](pcc-gpu-owner-backends.md). The intended peer
relationship is:

```text
host_backend=self       gpu_backend=pcc-metal
host_backend=self       gpu_backend=tvm-tilelang   # explicit optional provider
```

The selected GPU backend owns compile/package/launch for that execution and
must record requested backend == actual backend with `fallback_used=false`.
pcc continues to own Kernel IR/TIRx meaning, packed arguments, buffers, fences,
diagnostics, and claim manifests. This is how Metal becomes first-class like
`self` without giving an ambient TVM/TileLang installation uncontrolled
semantic ownership.

Current route status:

- `@pcc.gpu.kernel` vector add imports as `elementwise_add`; its broader finite
  scalar assignment, indexed load/store, arithmetic, comparison, and nested
  `if/else` subset imports as structured Kernel IR before TIRx/Metal emission.
- TileLang import already produces Kernel IR for the supported matmul subset.
- Unsupported `@gpu.kernel` shapes fail closed; no legacy Metal fallback is
  available.
- ds4 remains an external reference, but its bounded tensor/command lifetime
  section now has a fail-closed mapping onto pcc-owned buffer, alias, fence,
  readback, and deferred-free concepts. This CPU state machine does not import,
  link, or execute ds4 and is not a ds4 GPU support claim; see
  `pcc-ds4-gpu-api-mapping.md`.
- The first migrated ds4-shaped primitive is the pinned contiguous f32 copy
  oracle lowered through pcc Kernel IR/TIRx/pcc-metal and proven by real Metal
  readback; see `pcc-ds4-first-primitive.md`. No broader ds4 operator or model
  support follows from that one primitive.

## Training And Inference Layers

Training and inference should share the substrate:

- Kernel IR / TIRx freeze.
- TargetMachine and Metal/CUDA/ROCm finalizers.
- `PccBufferHandle`, `PccPackedArgs`, `PccFenceToken`.
- DLPack/tensor ownership and stream/fence semantics.
- Distributed collective primitives and checkpoint/resource manifests.

Inference-specific layers are KV block management, prefix cache, paged
attention, decode scheduling, model-weight residency, SSD/offload streaming,
and request timelines.

Training-specific layers are autograd, activation checkpointing, gradient
lifetime, optimizer state, mixed precision/loss scaling, DDP/FSDP/tensor
parallel collectives, pipeline schedules, checkpoint sharding, and elastic
restart.

Current pcc proves only kernel/runtime/metadata slices, not training.

## ds4 Route

The ds4 tree is an external oracle and long-term migration target, not a current
support claim. The first downloaded pin contains:

- C/runtime: `ds4.c`, `ds4.h`, `ds4_gpu.h`, `ds4_kvstore.*`,
  `ds4_ssd.*`, `ds4_distributed.*`.
- Metal host/runtime: `ds4_metal.m`.
- Metal kernels: `metal/*.metal` including copy/bin/dense/KV/RoPE/attention/
  MoE/norm/softmax/repeat/sum rows.
- CUDA/ROCm routes: `ds4_cuda.cu`, `ds4_rocm.cu`, `rocm/*.cuh`.
- GGUF tooling: `gguf-tools/`.
- Oracles/smokes: `tests/ds4_test.c`, `tests/test_q4k_dot.c`,
  `tests/cuda_long_context_smoke.c`.

The migration sequence is:

1. `DS4-P0-INVENTORY-ORACLE`: pin commit, inventory sources/Makefile targets,
   GPU API surface, distributed protocol, GGUF/KV/SSD surfaces, and native
   smoke vectors. No pcc compile claim.
2. CPU-only compile subset: classify pcc C frontend, libc, POSIX, mmap, socket,
   GGUF, and runtime gaps.
3. GPU API mapping: the 21-function tensor/command lifetime section is mapped
   exactly onto `PccTensorSlice`/`PccBufferHandle`/fence/readback/deferred-free
   concepts. The mapping is CPU-only and fail-closed; it does not execute ds4.
4. Primitive migration: contiguous f32 copy is proven through real readback;
   continue with fill, conversion/strided copy, argmax, topk/mask, q8 matmul, RoPE/norm,
   compressed-attention indexer, KV page copy/update, MoE expert cache, then
   full layer graph. Every primitive needs CPU oracle -> Kernel IR -> Metal
   source -> real Metal output -> ds4 oracle comparison.
5. KV/SSD/cache: unify ds4 streaming with pcc block-directory concepts using
   fence-protected residency states.
6. Distributed inference: coordinator/worker, layer range ownership,
   activation send/recv, prefill/decode route, KV shard ownership, and
   topology-neutral snapshot save/load.
7. Server/agent/benchmark parity last. Throughput is not correctness proof.

## Hard Gates

Dedicated hardware gates live under `tests/gpu_hardware/` so normal CI can
report explicit `SKIPPED_WITH_REASON` while Metal runners can run with
`PCC_GPU_HARDWARE_STRICT=1` to require device execution.

Current implemented gate:

```text
tests/gpu_hardware/test_metal_claim_levels.py
```

It proves `GPU_LEVEL_4_DEVICE_RESULT` for the current runtime-source copy,
imported TileLang/TIRx scalar GEMM, and opt-in 8x8 simdgroup GEMM primitives
when strict mode is enabled on this machine. It also asserts no `.metallib`,
pcc1-native launcher, five-GC parity, or whole-program GPU claim.

Remaining dedicated gates to add:

```text
tests/gpu_hardware/test_metal_copy_runtime_real.py
tests/gpu_hardware/test_metal_gemm_runtime_real.py
tests/gpu_hardware/test_metal_fence_deferred_free_real.py
tests/gpu_hardware/test_metal_pcc1_launch_real.py
tests/gpu_hardware/test_metal_5gc_lifetime_real.py
```

The primitive parity matrix is mandatory for copy, fill, reduce_sum,
scalar_gemm, simdgroup_gemm, attention_prefill, and KV page copy/update:

```text
CPU oracle
Kernel IR golden
Metal source
real Metal run
pcc1 no-libpython run
5-GC lifetime parity
```

No CPU oracle means no GPU correctness claim.

## Active Task Mapping

The actionable rows are in `docs/goal/task-board.yaml`:

- `GPU-P0-CANONICAL-KERNEL-IR-PATH`
- `GPU-P0-HARDWARE-LEVEL-GATES`
- `GPU-P0-METAL-PCC1-LAUNCH-REAL`
- `GPU-P0-METAL-5GC-LIFETIME-REAL`
- `GPU-P0-DLPACK-EXTERNAL-CAPSULE-INTEROP`
- `GPU-P0-GC-EXTERNAL-RESOURCE-SEAM`
- `GPU-P1-BROADER-TILELANG-TIRX-PASSES`
- `GPU-P0-OWNER-BACKEND-CONTRACT`
- `GPU-P0-PCC-METAL-OWNER-DRIVER`
- `GPU-P0-TVM-TILELANG-OWNER-DRIVER`
- `DIST-P0-LOCAL-COLLECTIVE-ORACLE-CODE`
- `DS4-P0-INVENTORY-ORACLE`
- `DS4-P1-CPU-COMPILE-SUBSET`
- `DS4-P2-GPU-API-MAPPING`
- `DS4-P3-PRIMITIVE-ORACLE`

Already landed `DONE_WEAK` rows remain useful but are not final completion:
runtime-source copy/GEMM/simdgroup, pcc-owned DLPack-shaped ownership, local
distributed oracles, and GPU-GC CPU/external-resource oracles all need
higher-level gates before production claims.

The two remaining GPU claim-level rows are deliberately split from
`GPU-P0-HARDWARE-LEVEL-GATES`: Level 4 device-result gates are not Level 5
pcc1-native launcher proof, and neither is Level 6 five-GC lifetime parity.
Keep them separate until the same workload proves each boundary.
